That's it! You have successfully installed Playwright in your project. You can explore the Playwright documentation for more advanced features and examples: https://playwright.dev/docs/intro

## How to Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- By default tests will be run on all 3 browsers, chromium, firefox and webkit using 3 workers. This can be configured in the playwright.config file. 
- Tests are run in <b>headless mode</b> meaning no browser will open up when running the tests.
    - `npx playwright test`
- If you want to run your Playwright script in **headed mode**, which means you can see the browser UI while the tests are running, you can do the following
    - `npx playwright test --headed`
